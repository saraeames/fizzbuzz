# Project Title

FizzBuzz Sample Website

## Description

Website home page has a form that accepts the following input: 

* Name
* Gender
* Marital Status
* Date of Birth
* An Arbitrary Integer

After form submission, input is stored in a session variable and the user is redirected to a results page. All form submissions in current session are visible on results page.  Submissions are grouped according to 'integer' input: 

* 'fizz' table contains all submissions where 'integer' is divisible by 3
* 'buzz' table contains all submissions where 'integer' is divisible by 5
* 'fizzbuzz' table contains all submissions where 'integer' is divisible by 3 and 5
* 'ungrouped' table contains all submissions that are not divisible by 3 or 5

There is a counter in the header that shows the count for each category.
